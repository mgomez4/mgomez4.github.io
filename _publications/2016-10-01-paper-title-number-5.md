In this paper we do three things. First, we describe a web-based coding tool that is open-source, publicly available and provides formative feedback and assessment. Second, we compare several metrics on student performance in courses that use the tool versus courses that do not use it when learning to program in Haskell. We find that the dropout rates are significantly lower in those courses that use the tool at two different universities. Finally we apply the technology acceptance model to analyse students perceptions.
