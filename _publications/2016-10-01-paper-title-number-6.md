This article analyzesa robot programming teaching experience in an Early Childhood Education  center.  Based  on  classroom  observations,  students  practice  sheets,  and focus group responses; we identified that children develop complex ideas about what a computer is, what programming is, an what programmers  do. Robot programming using  an  iconic  language  also  allows  developing  computational  concepts  such  as sequence,   parameter,   loops   and   conditional. 5-year-oldchildren   established correspondence between the code that they programmed and the robot movements, learning the concept of computers as a programmable machine. The 3 to 4-year-oldchildren do not mastered this idea.
