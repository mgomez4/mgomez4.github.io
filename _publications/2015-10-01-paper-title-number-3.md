We present UNC++Duino, an open source educative software for learning to program a robotic kit in C++ and Python. Besides of these two industry programming languages, UNC++Duino can be programmed using 2 high level languages based on blocks are free of syntax errors. One of the block based languages included is completely iconic allowing for its use with preliterate children. The hardware we use with UNC++Duino, the open RobotGroup robotic kit, can be used to build different automated constructions based on an Arduino board, sensors and actuators. UNC++Duino was developed within Argentinean K-12 schools by the Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba with the collaboration and support of the Argentinean National Ministry of Science and the RISE program in Google for Education. Its goal is to provide an engaging tool for learning to program in different programming languages with increasing difficulty and control of the hardware.
